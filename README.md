# Washing-machine-panel
In this project we needed to design and implement the control panel of a washing machine using your STM32L476RG Nucleo-64 microcontroller development board. The panel was built on a breadboard, using many components like LEDs, sensors, a bunch of wires, buttons, etc. This code contains the controls and the features of the panel.
